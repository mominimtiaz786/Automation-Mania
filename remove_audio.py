Yes, you can use the MoviePy library in Python to remove the audio track from a video. MoviePy is a Python library for video editing that allows you to manipulate videos and create custom video clips.
To install the MoviePy library, you will need to have Python and pip (Python package manager) installed on your computer. To install MoviePy, open a terminal and run the following command:
"""
# pip install moviepy

"""
Once the library is installed, you can use the VideoFileClip class to load a video and the AudioFileClip class to load the audio track. You can then use the set_audio method of the VideoFileClip class to set the audio track to None, effectively removing the audio from the video. Here is an example of how to use MoviePy to remove the audio track from a video:
"""
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, AudioFileClip

# Set the path to the video file
video_path = "/path/to/video.mp4"

# Load the video using the `VideoFileClip` class
video = VideoFileClip(video_path)

# Set the audio track of the video to `None`
video.audio = None

# Save the video to a new file
video.write_videofile("/path/to/output.mp4")


"""
This code will load the video file at the specified video_path, remove the audio track, and save the resulting video to a new file.
