Yes, you can use the Facebook Graph API to access Instagram data and perform actions on Instagram, such as uploading media and scheduling posts. To use the Facebook Graph API, you will need to have a Facebook developer account and create an app.
To use the Facebook Graph API with Python, you can use the facebook-sdk library, which is a Python wrapper for the Facebook Graph API. To install the facebook-sdk library, you will need to have Python and pip (Python package manager) installed on your computer.
To install the facebook-sdk library, open a terminal and run the following command:
"""
# pip install facebook-sdk

"""
Once the library is installed, you can use the GraphAPI class to authenticate your account and make requests to the Facebook Graph API. Here is an example of how to use the GraphAPI class to authenticate your account and upload a video to Instagram:
"""

import facebook

# Set your Facebook app ID and app secret
APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID"
APP_SECRET = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"

# Set the access token for your Instagram business account
ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Set the path to the video file to be uploaded
video_path = "/path/to/video.mp4"

# Set the caption for the video
caption = "This is a caption for my video."

# Set the date and time for the video to be published
publish_time = "2022-12-19T00:00:00Z"

# Create an instance of the `GraphAPI` class
graph = facebook.GraphAPI(access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN, version="3.1")

# Define the payload for the request
payload = {
    "caption": caption,
    "published": False,  # Set to False to schedule the video to be published later
    "scheduled_publish_time": publish_time,  # Set the date and time for the video to be published
    "source": open(video_path, "rb"),
    "type": "video",
}

# Make a POST request to the Instagram Business API to upload the video
response = graph.request("me/media", method="POST", data=payload)

# Print the response from the request
print(response)

"""
This code will upload the video file at the specified video_path to Instagram and schedule it to be published at the date and time specified in the scheduled_publish_time field of the payload object.

Keep in mind that to use the Facebook Graph API with Instagram, you will need to have an Instagram business account and have linked it to a Facebook Page.
